# Computer Vision
Material from the Udacity computer vision course

It contains solutions to the three main projects:

1. [Facial Keypoint Detection](facial-keypoints): Train a network to detect 68 facial keypoints.
1. [Image Captioning](image-captioning): Train a CNN and a generative RNN to create captions for images.
1. [Landmark Detection & Tracking (SLAM)](slam/workspace): Implement the GraphSLAM algorithm to track a moving agent's position and locate given landmarks.
